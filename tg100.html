        <h3>THE BEST BELONG HERE</h3>

        <h1>Tennis Goat 100</h1>
        <p>Tennis Goat 100 (TG100) is a tennis-based startup where I dedicated four months of my first Co-op semester. During the term, I served my role as a Multimedia Designer, leading the <span>design and prototyping of a website.</span> While primarily an individual project, I collaborated briefly with a back-end developer during the latter phases of the project.</p>

                <p>This web design project began with a detailed briefing from my supervisor outlining the specific content requirements for a website I was tasked to design. During our meeting, I took notes to ensure I captured all essential elements necessary for the interactive website. Key components included an introduction video, specific criteria, and a list of ATP and WTA tennis players ranked according to specific criteria. <br><br>My objective was to craft a user interface centred around these focal elements while maintaining a minimalist layout that stayed true to the company's branding. So, to gain a thorough understanding of the company's brand identity, I also engaged in discussions with the previous designer. This allowed me to delve into TG100's colour schemes, thematic elements, preferred fonts, and overall ethos, ensuring that the design aligned seamlessly with the brand's established identity.

                <h3>CHALLENGE</h3>
                <p>One of the primary challenges I encountered was the frequent need to update the website design due to updated requirements from my supervisor. With the project's direction not firmly established, there were constant changes, causing my progress and workflow to be stagnant or redundant at times. Because the website layout depended on its content to some extent, large changes to the text or images would affect how the design functioned.</p>
                <h3>SOLUTION</h3>
                <p>To address this challenge, I found utilizing 'components' in Figma to be particularly effective. Components in Figma are elements that can be reused throughout designs and allow for efficient prototyping. Since these components can be anything from buttons to entire sections of a design, this approach helped increase my workflow efficiency even amidst the various adjustments I was asked to make.

        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
        <p>As the project progressed, a web developer joined my team to collaborate on coding the actual website. With this new addition, I was responsible for organizing my files and ensuring the developer had access to all necessary graphics. Additionally, I prioritized promptly updating the prototype as I worked to see that both the developer and I remained aligned throughout the design process. <br><br>Overall, the project demanded strong communication skills and effective collaboration. Through consistent practice, I found myself becoming more adept at expressing my ideas clearly and organizing my work efficiently.
