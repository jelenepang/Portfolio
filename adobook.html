        <h3>DIGITAL RECIPE BOOK</h3>

        <h1>Adobook</h1>
        <p>Adobook, designed during a Spring 2023 Interface Design course, is a collaborative effort among three <span>UI/UX</span> team members, including myself. This interactive system hopes to keep Filipino traditions alive and preserve culture through food and community. Later designed as a mobile app, Adobook serves as a convenient database for users to store, access, and share their favorite recipes with family.</p>

                <p>This project kicked off with a simple prompt: to develop an interactive system. The initial focus was on identifying the target audience. After diving deep into research, we narrowed down our focus to a specific domain of people in which we could make a significant impact. This involved understanding their objectives, routines, potential growth areas, and obstacles. By focusing our scope and interviewing Filipino families, I crafted one of three personas to guide the subsequent brainstorming sessions effectively.

                <p>During the brainstorming phase, we explored three potential directions for the project: a Recipe Translator, an Online Recipe-Sharing System, and a Digital Recipe Book. Following a constructive critique session, it was decided that the Digital Recipe Book held the most promise and aligned best with our goals.<br><br>
                Like most design processes, I began by sketching out various concepts to generate ideas and visualize possibilities. Although each team member contributed their own designs, the final concept closely resembled my initial sketches. I subsequently transitioned these ideas into an initial Figma design, where we collaborated as a team to integrate everyone's input and refine the design.

                <h3>01 CHALLENGE</h3>
                <p>While the overall progress remained steady, there were hurdles that highlighted the necessity of aligning Adobook more closely with its intended users. The app was developed with a focus on features like recipe addition and data collection. However, during an in-class critique sessions, feedback showed that this manual approach to data entry did not cater well to the app's target users. Given that it's demographic includes seniors who may rely solely on hard copy recipes, Adobook needed to offer a more user-friendly solution for recipe entry.</p>
                <h3>SOLUTION</h3>
                <p>To address this challenge, I proposed a feature enabling image scanning. This function would convert images into text, alleviating the need for manual data entry and thereby easing the usability for our target audience. Additonally, I suggested that the app should support audio recordings to further improve accessiblity.</p>

            <h3>02 CHALLENGE</h3>
            <p>Following the class critiques, we conducted a pilot usability test to further refine our design and enhance the app's user interface experience. I assumed the role of observer and note-taker in this test, documenting observations and feedback. Here's a summarized overview of the test results, along with the issues I pinpointed during the session. While participants were very particular in their assessment of the interface design, this experience brought Adobook to a higher level of fidelity. I found the session incredibly informative, shedding light on users' perspectives and insights throughout the process.</p>

        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
        <p>Adobook turned out to be a meticulously researched design that my team and I take great pride in. Throughout this project, I learned the importance of collaboration and effective task allocation when working alongside my groupmates. By keeping each other accountable, we created an environment where exchanged ideas and constructive feedback helped us move forward consistently. This project proves the significance of teamwork and communication in achieving thoroughly designed interactive system.</p>
